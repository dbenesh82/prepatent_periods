# Long life cycles and parasite growth and development in definitive hosts

Some parasites have long, convoluted life cycles in which they infect multiple hosts before reproducing. In this repository, I use a [database](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.1680/suppinfo) of helminth (parasitic worm) life cycles to explore how life cycles affect parasite growth and development in their final, definitive hosts. I find that prepatent periods and growth rates do not consistently differ between simple- and complex-cycle parasites. However, complex-cycle parasites tend to enter the definitive host at a much larger size, because they grow in intermediate hosts. The analysis can be read [here](adult_size_devo.md)
